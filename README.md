# Survey Autofill Chrome Extension

Currently supports surveys from **Fieldwork.com**, **Userinterviews.com**, and **Surveymonkey.com**.

Participating in market research requires filling out a lot of surveys. Even though these companies have all your info, for some reason they want you to fill them in over and over for every survey... This expedites the process by autocompleting portions of the survey, and also adds some handy keyboard shortcuts to fill them out faster :)

## Installation

Put all the files into a single folder, then install the extension by following these instructions: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked

Right click the extension icon in Chrome to open the options page and fill out the autofill data: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/options/

## Controls

Press [Tab] to progress the survey.
Press [1-9] to fill out radio buttons.

A form can be quickly filled out with a combination of the number keys and tab :)
